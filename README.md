## What is Masters of the Rift?
Masters of the rift is a 1v1 online game based on League of Legends. This project was created as part of Riot Games API Challenge 2016 and aims to show how mastery data can be used as part of a broader, more social experience.

This is not the first time that we have entered the API Challenge as a team, we entered a project back in 2015 that aimed to make generating Item Sets much easier to players. We knew that this year the premise would be complete changing and we werenâ€™t wrong. This year's API challenge has broadened greatly in terms of what type of projects can be made.

For our entry we wanted to focus on the Entertainment Category, We really liked the idea of creating a live and dynamic experience for players, we also saw encouragement towards an entertainment entry that could show a social value to players.

Our entry allows players to play online against each other in a 1v1 battle to see who knows the most about champions, items and players in league of legends.
